| tuyaMcu_sendState | [dpID][dpType][dpValue] | Manually send set state command. Do not use it. Use mapping, so communication is bidirectional and automatic. | File: driver/drv_tuyaMCU.c<br/>Function: TuyaMCU_SendStateCmd |
| tuyaMcu_setBaudRate | [BaudValue] | Sets the baud rate used by TuyaMCU UART communication. Default value is 9600. Some other devices require 115200. | File: driver/drv_tuyaMCU.c<br/>Function: TuyaMCU_SetBaudRate |
| tuyaMcu_setDimmerRange | [Min][Max] | Set dimmer range used by TuyaMCU | File: driver/drv_tuyaMCU.c<br/>Function: TuyaMCU_SetDimmerRange |
| tuyaMcu_setupLED | Cmd_TuyaMCU_SetupLED |  | File: driver/drv_tuyaMCU.c<br/>Function: NULL); |
| tuyaMcu_testSendTime |  | Sends a example date by TuyaMCU to clock/callendar MCU | File: driver/drv_tuyaMCU.c<br/>Function: TuyaMCU_Send_SetTime_Example |
| uartFakeHex | [HexString] | Spoofs a fake hex packet so it looks like TuyaMCU send that to us. Used for testing. | File: driver/drv_uart.c<br/>Function: CMD_UART_FakeHex |
| uartInit | [BaudRate] | Manually starts UART1 port. Keep in mind that you don't need to do it for TuyaMCU and BL0942, those drivers do it automatically. | File: driver/drv_uart.c<br/>Function: CMD_UART_Init |
| uartSendASCII | [AsciiString] | Sends given string by UART. | File: driver/drv_uart.c<br/>Function: CMD_UART_Send_ASCII |
| uartSendHex | [HexString] | Sends raw data by UART, can be used to send TuyaMCU data, but you must write whole packet with checksum yourself | File: driver/drv_tuyaMCU.c<br/>Function: CMD_UART_Send_Hex |
| UCS1912_Test |  |  | File: driver/drv_ucs1912.c<br/>Function: UCS1912_Test |
| VCPPrecision | [VoltageDigits][CurrentDigitsAmpers][PowerDigitsWats][EnergyDigitsWh] | Sets the number of digits after decimal point for power metering publishes. Default is BL09XX_VCPPrecision 1 3 2 3. This works for OBK-style publishes. | File: driver/drv_bl_shared.c<br/>Function: BL09XX_VCPPrecision |
| VCPPublishIntervals | [MinDelayBetweenPublishes][ForcedPublishInterval] | First argument is minimal allowed interval in second between Voltage/Current/Power/Energy publishes (even if there is a large change), second value is an interval in which V/C/P/E is always published, even if there is no change | File: driver/drv_bl_shared.c<br/>Function: BL09XX_VCPPublishIntervals |
| VCPPublishThreshold | [VoltageDeltaVolts][CurrentDeltaAmpers][PowerDeltaWats][EnergyDeltaWh] | Sets the minimal change between previous reported value over MQTT and next reported value over MQTT. Very useful for BL0942, BL0937, etc. So, if you set, VCPPublishThreshold 0.5 0.001 0.5, it will only report voltage again if the delta from previous reported value is largen than 0.5V. Remember, that the device will also ALWAYS force-report values every N seconds (default 60) | File: driver/drv_bl_shared.c<br/>Function: BL09XX_VCPPublishThreshold |
| VoltageSet | Voltage | Measure the real voltage with an external, reliable power meter and enter this voltage via this command to calibrate. The calibration is automatically saved in the flash memory. | File: driver/drv_pwrCal.c<br/>Function: NULL); |
| waitFor | [EventName] [Argument] | Wait forever for event. Can be used within script. For example, you can do: waitFor MQTTState 1 or waitFor NTPState 1. You can also do waitFor NoPingTime 600 to wait for 600 seconds without ping watchdog getting successful reply | File: cmnds/cmd_script.c<br/>Function: CMD_waitFor |
